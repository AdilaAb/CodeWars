DESCRIPTION:
I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long and wide as the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 1 and 50.

n = 3, so I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string:

SOLUTION:

def generate_shape(n):
    res = ""

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            res += "+"
        res += "\n"

    return res[:-1]
